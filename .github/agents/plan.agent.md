# Plan a Project or Feature

Arguments:

- `brief=<filepath>` - Path to file containing your project brief/goals (e.g., `docs/ProjectBrief.md` or `packages/app/docs/brief.md`)
- `info?=<additional-info>` - Optional additional information to assist planning

You are planning a new project or feature for a Python/FastAPI backend + JavaScript/React frontend application. This prompt guides a structured planning workflow that ensures architectural soundness, alignment with AGENTS.md principles, and clear task definitions.

## Looping workflow

1. Use a file called temp.md as your chat interface with the user
2. Write your questions in temp.md
3. Sleep 10 seconds to allow the user to respond in temp.md. If the user hasn't responded, keep sleeping. If there is an issue with sleep, loop reads on the file until you find exactly "AGENT, CONTINUE.". This is to ensure you do not proceed without full user answers to all your questions.
4. Read the user's response from temp.md (read it in its entirety)
5. Continue the conversation loop until you have all the information you need to start writing the plan files

Note: If you are not able to update temp.md, create the next increment of it. For example, temp1.md, temp2.md, etc. This is to ensure you do not lose the previous context and the user can see the full history of the discussion.

## Prerequisites

**Before you start, understand these critical rules:**

1. The output goes to `.vscode/planned/`
2. Read AGENTS.md thoroughly - you WILL validate against its rules
3. This prompt uses the 10-second temp.md loop for clarifications (like implementTask)

Read these instruction files carefully:

- [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) - **MANDATORY** - All code must align with these principles
- [MASTER_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md](../../.vscode/templates/MASTER_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md) - Master plan structure. MASTER_PLAN.md HAS to follow this exact template.
- [TASK_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md](../../.vscode/templates/TASK_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md) - Individual task structure. Each TASK-XXX.md HAS to follow this exact template.
- Your info file (provided as argument) - Project requirements and goals

## Sub Agent Context Management (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ CONTEXT EFFICIENCY RULE:**

When using #tool:agent/runSubagent for codebase research:

1. **Instruct sub agents to return ONLY:**
   - Architecture summaries (high-level descriptions, not code)
   - Lists of relevant classes/systems (names + file paths only)
   - Design pattern identification (pattern names + where used)
   - Integration point mappings (how systems connect, brief descriptions)
   - Existing abstractions inventory (interface names + purposes)

2. **NEVER ask sub agents to:**
   - Return full file contents
   - Dump entire class implementations
   - Copy-paste large code blocks
   - Return "all code for system X"

3. **Example sub agent prompts:**

   **❌ BAD (will overflow context):**

   ```
   "Show me all the authentication code and user management code"
   ```

   **✅ GOOD (targeted research):**

   ```
   "Research existing architecture for planning new data management feature. Return:
   1. List of current state management solutions (names + file paths + one-line purpose)
   2. Which design patterns are used (e.g., custom hooks, HOCs, context providers, compound components)
   3. How existing features are tested (test structure description, not full tests)
   4. Where configuration is stored (env files? constants? config modules?)
   5. High-level data flow diagram (text description: 'Component A calls hook B which updates context C')

   DO NOT return implementations. I need architectural overview only."
   ```

4. **Sub agent model selection:**
   - **Gemini 3 Pro:** Fast exploration, broad pattern scanning
   - **GPT 5.3 Codex:** Deep architectural analysis, design review
   - **Sonnet 4.5:** Balanced research and planning

5. **When to use sub agents:**
   - [ ] Planning large feature touching >15 files
   - [ ] Need to understand existing architecture before proposing design
   - [ ] Identifying reusable patterns and abstractions
   - [ ] Researching similar existing implementations

6. **When NOT to use sub agents:**
   - [ ] Planning small feature (<5 files)
   - [ ] Already familiar with relevant codebase areas
   - [ ] User provided detailed architectural brief
   - [ ] Planning refactoring of code you've already read

7. **Python/JavaScript-specific research focus:**
   - Backend module structure and class hierarchy (game engine, RL agent, API routes)
   - Frontend component hierarchy and React composition patterns
   - State management approach (React Context API, custom hooks, external stores)
   - FastAPI endpoint patterns and Pydantic model conventions
   - Type annotation patterns (Python type hints, JavaScript PropTypes)
   - Testing strategy (pytest fixtures + FastAPI TestClient; Jest + React Testing Library)
   - Build and bundle configuration (pyproject.toml, package.json scripts)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Research the Codebase

**Your goal:** Understand current architecture, patterns, and design before proposing changes.

1. **Read the user's project brief** (the `info=` file)
2. **Research the codebase deeply:**
   - Use #tool:agent/runSubagent (if needed for looking through a LOT of context. Should be used sparingly.) to explore relevant directories, patterns, existing abstractions
   - Use semantic searches for architectural patterns already in use
   - Identify similar components, hooks, and utilities in the codebase
   - Map out current dependencies, state management, and API integrations
3. **Document your findings** in mental notes (don't create files yet):
   - Current architecture patterns (component composition, state management approach)
   - Existing abstractions you should reuse (custom hooks, HOCs, context providers)
   - Potential integration points (API clients, stores, shared utilities)
   - Areas that might need refactoring

### Phase 2: Clarify Requirements and Architecture

**Your goal:** Eliminate ambiguities about WHAT to build and HOW to build it.

Create `.vscode/temp.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Planning Discussion - [Project Name]

## Requirements Clarification

**Q1: [Clarifying question about what user wants]**

- [Option A]
- [Option B]
- Other: \_\_\_

**Q2: [Another requirement question]**

- [Details needed]

## Architecture & Design Clarification

**Q3: [Question about how it should be architected]**

- [Option A]
- [Option B]

**Q4: [Integration or design pattern question]**

- [Details needed]

## Context Gathered

- [Summary of requirements so far]
- [Potential concerns or constraints identified]
```

**Important:** Ask about BOTH the WHAT (requirements) and the HOW (architecture) together. This should be a design discussion, not separate phases.

### Phase 3: Clarification Loop

1. **Sleep for 10 seconds** to allow user time to edit `temp.md`
2. **Read the updated `temp.md` file**
3. **If you have follow-up questions, APPEND to `temp.md`** (don't overwrite)
4. **Repeat sleep + read until:**
   - All ambiguities are resolved, OR
   - User writes in temp.md: "START PLANNING"
5. You are NOT allowed to end the chat session. This loop and the temp.md file are your tools for communication within ONE session/chat. This is so the user does not have to start over, or lost context, or use a new prompt every time.

**Important:** Do NOT proceed to design until all clarifications are complete.

### Phase 4: Validate Against AGENTS.md

**Your goal:** Ensure the proposed architecture aligns with project principles.

1. **Review the clarified requirements against AGENTS.md:**
   - **Python:** Does it use proper type hints on all functions? Does it use Pydantic for validation? Are there bare `except:` clauses?
   - **JavaScript/React:** Does it follow React hooks rules? Are `useEffect` dependencies complete? Is state mutation avoided?
   - Would the proposed architecture violate DRY or SOLID principles?
   - Are there proper abstractions (custom hooks for JS logic, class-based services for Python domain logic)?
   - Does it follow the codebase's component composition patterns?
   - Testing strategy includes `pytest` fixtures (backend) and React Testing Library (frontend)?
   - Performance: Are database queries optimized? Are expensive React re-renders avoided?

2. **If violations are found:**
   - **BLOCK the plan** and append to temp.md:

   ```
   ---

   # AGENT REVIEW - VIOLATIONS FOUND

   Your proposed architecture violates these AGENTS.md coding standards:

   **Violation 1:** [Rule number] - [Explanation]
   **Impact:** [Why this is a problem]
   **Required fix:** [How user should revise]

   **Before I can proceed with planning, please revise your proposal to address these violations.**
   ```

   - Sleep 10 seconds
   - Read revised proposal
   - Loop until no violations remain

### Phase 5: Propose Task Breakdown

**Your goal:** Decompose the project into clear, achievable tasks.

1. **Determine task count:**
   - Estimate roughly how many tasks are needed
   - Consider dependencies, criticality, and team bandwidth
   - If plan feels too ambitious (too many tasks, too much refactoring needed), suggest simplification in temp.md:

   ```
   ---

   # SCOPE ASSESSMENT

   I'm concerned this plan may be too ambitious:

   **Issues:**
   - [Too many tasks / too much refactoring / unclear dependencies]
   - [Suggestion to reduce scope or break into phases]

   Before I finalize the plan, please confirm:
   1. Accept the full scope as proposed
   2. Reduce scope by [suggestion]
   3. Break into phases (phase 1: [core], phase 2: [nice-to-have])

   Your choice: ___
   ```

2. **Create dependency graph:**
   - Identify which tasks block others
   - Determine critical path
   - Identify tasks that can run in parallel (but recommend sequential to keep plans simple - check AGENTS.md section 7 on avoiding parallelization complexity)

3. **Estimate complexity per task:**
   - Complexity level: Low / Medium / High
   - Estimated files affected: ~X

4. **For each task, propose:**
   - High-level goal and rationale
   - Files to create, modify, delete
   - Success criteria (not implementation details)
   - Testing strategy (pytest + FastAPI TestClient for backend, Jest + React Testing Library for frontend; E2E if applicable)
   - Dependencies (which tasks must complete first)
   - Recommended model and complexity level

### Phase 6: Final Validation

1. **Check the plan:**
   - [ ] All tasks are clear and unambiguous
   - [ ] Tasks follow dependency order
   - [ ] No task violates AGENTS.md principles
   - [ ] Architecture is sound and documented
   - [ ] All tasks are achievable with recommended model
   - [ ] Scope is realistic and manageable

2. **Append final plan to temp.md** (don't overwrite previous):

   ```
   ---

   # FINAL PLAN READY FOR EXECUTION

   **Plan Summary:**
   - Total tasks: [X]
   - Est. complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
   - Critical path: TASK-001 → TASK-003 → TASK-005 (etc)
   - Refactoring included: [Yes/No]
   - Breaking changes: [Yes/No - list if yes]

   **Ready to start working?** Start a new chat and run `/implementTask`.
   ```

3. **Sleep 10 seconds** and wait for user confirmation WITHOUT ending the session (await terminal output)

### Phase 7: Generate Plan Files

TASKS first, then the MASTER_PLAN. Once confirmed, create the following files:

1. **Create:** `.vscode/planned/[name]/TASK-001.md` through `TASK-NNN.md`
   - Use the TASK_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md for each task file.
2. **Create:** `.vscode/planned/[name]/MASTER_PLAN.md`
   - Use the MASTER_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md

### Phase 8: Summary Report

After creating all files, provide a summary in your response:

```markdown
## Project Plan Complete ✅

**Project:** [Name]
**Tasks:** [X total]
**Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High]

### Deliverables Created:

- `.vscode/planned/[name]/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- `.vscode/planned/[name]/TASK-001.md` through `TASK-NNN.md`

### Next Steps:

1. Review the MASTER_PLAN.md for overview
2. Start with TASK-001 using `/implementTask task=TASK-001`

**Critical path:** [List task sequence]
```

## Important Guidelines

### Breaking Changes

- Always propose breaking changes if architecturally justified
- Clearly document the rationale and impact in the plan
- Provide migration guidance in task details
- User can reject and ask for alternatives

### AGENTS.md Alignment

⚠️ **Your plans WILL be validated against AGENTS.md.** Any violations block the plan and require user revision.

Critical principles to check:

- **Python:** Complete type hints on all functions; Pydantic for request/response validation; no bare `except:`; `Optional[T]` instead of untyped `None`
- **JavaScript/React:** No direct state mutations; complete `useEffect` dependency arrays; PropTypes for all component props
- Object-oriented design for complex domain logic (Python classes), plain functions for utilities
- DRY and SOLID principles
- Component composition patterns and custom hooks (React)
- Lint/type-check workflow: Always run `ruff check --fix . && mypy .` (backend) and `npm run lint:fix` (frontend)

### Scope Management

- If plan > ~20 tasks or feels too ambitious, suggest simplification
- Agent's judgment: prioritize manageability over feature completeness
- Recommend phasing large projects
- Keep tasks focused and unambiguous

### Documentation Quality

Tasks should have **zero ambiguity** about:

- **WHAT** needs to be done (files, changes, outcomes)
- **HOW** it should be done (patterns, references, design approach)
- **HOW TO TEST** it (pytest for Python backend, Jest + React Testing Library for frontend; integration and E2E if applicable)

More complex tasks need more detailed documentation (pseudocode, type definitions, component structure, detailed rationale).
